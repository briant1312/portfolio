                I am a naturally curious person who has always had a love for trying new things. I enjoy spending time
                with friends and family and always down for cards. After more than a decade in logistics I decided to pivot
                to something I was more passionate about and haven't been happier since. I have always enjoyed technology and
                loved taking things apart as a kid to see how everything worked. I have been on a journey in software and web 
                development for going on a year now. I am looking forward to continuously growing as a developer and excited to see
                what comes next.

                    <p>
                            My first project was the classic board game checkers. This app follows all the traditional rules of 
                            checkers including crowning kings, jumping multiple pieces in one turn and forced captures. This was 
                            a solo project built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I have always loved board games and had
                            a lot of fun finding different ways to solve problems while building this app.

                    <p>
                        I learned to cook years ago and always enjoy finding new recipes to try out. I wanted to create an app that
                        would allow me to keep track of all of my recipes. This is a full stack CRUD app that utilized bearer token 
                        authentication. Once the user has logged in they can start adding recipes to their collection. I also added
                        a page to view all recipes to make it a little easier to demo. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and 
                        vanilla JavaScript.

                    <p>
                        Clowning Around is the clown themed forum that you never knew you needed. This was a group project 
                        that was built with the git forking workflow. It is a full stack app that was created using the MERN stack.
                        What started out as a joke ended up being one of the funnest project that I worked on. We were a team of 4
                        and got a lot of practice working in a group environment and troubleshooting each others code.

                    <p>
                        It's always a good idea to keep an eye on your expenses. This is why I wanted to create an expense tracker
                        that would allow the user to add expenses into a variety of categories, as well as including their income.
                        This app incorporates ChartJS so that you can get a visualization of where your hard earned money is being
                        spent. This project was made by me and one other developer and was built using the MERN stack.
